                        <p>MoldovaNews is proud to operate as a news organization dedicated to providing free, unbiased, and comprehensive coverage of events in Moldova and beyond.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a organization, we do not accept donations for our operations. Our commitment is to maintain complete editorial independence and serve the public interest without financial influence.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>We believe that access to quality journalism should be free and available to everyone. Our team of dedicated journalists works tirelessly to bring you accurate, timely, and relevant news coverage.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Support Worthy Causes</h3>
                        <p>While we don't accept donations, we encourage our readers to support organizations that make a real difference in our communities and around the world. MoldovaNews is built on a subscription-based model, which means we do not rely on one-time contributions but rather on consistent support from our readership. This structure allows us to remain independent and focused on delivering reliable journalism, while also giving us the ability to contribute to causes beyond our newsroom.

Part of every subscription goes directly to UNICEF, helping to fund global programs that protect children, ensure access to education, and provide essential healthcare services in regions where they are most needed. By subscribing, readers are not just supporting quality reporting; they are also making a tangible impact on the lives of children worldwide.

At the same time, we encourage our audience to look at the other organizations we feature on our platform. Save the Children works tirelessly to give children a healthy start in life and protect them from harm. Doctors Without Borders continues to provide urgent medical care in places affected by disasters, epidemics, and conflict. Here in Moldova, Red Cross Moldova is on the ground delivering humanitarian assistance and relief services to communities in need.

Supporting these groups, whether directly or by raising awareness, ensures that critical work continues. Subscribing to MoldovaNews means being part of a broader commitment to solidarity, compassion, and meaningful change both at home and around the globe.</p>
